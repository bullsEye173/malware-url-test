# malware-url-test

## Libraries used
- Spring Boot for building a Java Spring application. The Spring Boot contains an in-built Tomcat Webserver and in-memory db(H2) for storing non-malicious URLs.
- Spring Data Elastic Search for faster searches and storing the malicious URLs retreived from 3rd Party Services.
- Spring REST Controller and Services for building the REST API
- Swagger Open API tool for testing the REST API.
- JUnit and Mockito for running Unit tests.

## Description
This Project loads the list of Users into Elastic and Searches. 
Using the following endpoints, different operations can be achieved:
- `GET /urlinfo/1?hostname_and_port={hostname_and_port}&original_path_and_query_string={original_path_and_query_string}` - This REST API check if it safe to access the URL or not.
- `GET /urlinfo/1/all` - This REST API returns the list of all non-malicious URLs in the db.
- `POST /urlinfo/1` - This REST API creates a new URL in the db, i.e. if it is non-malicious.

## Setup and running the application:
- Make sure you have C:\Java\jdk1.8.0_202 in your machine
- Make sure you have C:\Programs\apache-maven-3.5.4 in your machine
- Then run the build_full.bat file in the repository to build the Spring Boot Application. This should create malware-url-test-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar file in the target directory
- Now run the Spring boot command "java -jar target/malware-url-test-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar" to run the application.
- Now type `http://localhost:8080` in the browser. This will automatically redirect to `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html`. Please make sure to click on "Show/Hide" link on the page.
